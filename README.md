# archlinux-docker

This is a Arch-Linux docker container with some preinstalled packages, like
base, base-devel, pacaur and ssh.

There is also a user named ``user`` with password ``user``. This user is member
of the ``sudo`` group.
Because it is not allowed to execute pacaur as root user, this user can be used
to run it.
